### What is Eventify?
Eventify was the second project of our bootcamp. We created this front end website with the idea of building an application that will provide the user with lists of events that are occuring in their given cities. To begin with we used Atlanta and Savannah, two of the most well renowned industrial cities in not only the state of Georgia but the south, as well as Sandy Springs, a smaller suburban community outside of Atlanta. By selecting one of these cities you are taken to a list of events, choosing an event takes you to the event details page that displays data such as date and location, and clicking the map button takes you to the map view page that displays your location in relation to the respective event. 

### Technologies Used
-HTML 

-CSS

-Javascript
 
  -jQuery
 
  -particles.js
 
### Minimum Viable Product
- A Home page with a directory of a set of locations
- A navbar that allows you to navigate back home (from the events list), back to events (from the single event listing), or to the about page from any point in the website.
-An events page that lists a collection of events based on location and ordered by date
-The caveat with this is that the minimum viable product we could generate within the weeks time alloted, the amount of overall knowledge we had, as well as availability of technologies was a list of events from Ticketmaster's API. This means the results data is limited to what they have in their system however we have further ambitions of expanding this project to include all kinds events from movies to museums to even bars and clubs.
